  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      BSSID requires your Developer Signing Identity, which can be found by issuing the following command on the CLI:
        security find-identity -v -p codesigning
      in order to provide entitlements to the binary (hard requirement for Catalina).
      The Identity may be set as an environment variable as follows:
        HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_FILTERING=1 SIGN_ID="abcdef123456" brew install bssid
    EOS
  end
end
